# Summary of Markdown

## Italics and Bold 
To make a phrase _Italics_, you can surround words with underscore (_). For examples, <span style="color:pink">\_this\_</span> would look like _this_.

To make a phrase **Bold**, surround words with two asterisks (\*\*). For example, `**this**` would look like **this**.

You can use `bold and italics` at the same time. For example, \*\*\_this\_\*\* would look like **_this_**.

## Headers
There are 6 types of Headers. To make a header in Markdown, put \# in the front the phrase. <span style="color:pink">**Attention**</span>: there should be a blank space between \# and the phrase. The number of \# represents the size of the Headers. For example \# is Header one, the largest one. \#\# is Header two, the second largest one.


## Links
* **Inline link**  
 Put the context in `[ ]` and link address in `( )` follows. This will generate a link for the context.   
 For example \[google\]\(www.google.com\) will looks like this: [google](www.google.com).

 * **Referrence link**  
 It is a Similar idea with inline link. The link address will be used like a variable. If you want to \[link A\] represent a link. You write \[link A\]: www.tudelft.nl. Then you can use \[link A\] as a variable to represent that link.
 For example, \[TU Delft\]\[link A\] will look like this [TU Delft][link A].  
An advantage of the reference link style is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once

## Images
Image of syntax is nearly the same as links, both inline link and reference link. You only need to put ! in the front.   
For example,\!\[cat\]\(https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/12A9B/production/_111434467_gettyimages-1143489763.jpg\) will display a image of cat ![cat](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/12A9B/production/_111434467_gettyimages-1143489763.jpg)
